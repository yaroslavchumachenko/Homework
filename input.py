#the right way to import
import os
import sys
#the wrong way
import sys, os 
#import of your own moduls
import os
#import files_for_practice (you need to create file __init__)!!!!
#if you have this file, you can call it a "package"
#from files_for_practice import simple
#you should use prioritization of libraries import os -> import file -> from os -> from file
import sys
from sys import path
path("User/Windows...")
#BUT if you didnt connect specific function, you should write the name of library:
import sys
sys.path("...")
import random
random.randint()
#python framework - like Django
#framework >>> package or library
